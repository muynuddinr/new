      question: "How does automated invoice generation work?",
      answer: "Our automated invoice generation system seamlessly converts completed work orders into professional invoices with a single click. The system pulls all relevant data including labor hours, parts used, service descriptions, and customer information to create accurate invoices without manual data entry. This eliminates errors, saves time, and ensures consistent billing across all jobs."
    },
    {
      question: "What payment methods are supported?",
      answer: "Fielduo supports a comprehensive range of payment methods including credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover), ACH bank transfers, digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay), and mobile payment solutions. Our system is designed to give your customers maximum flexibility while ensuring secure transactions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can invoices be customized with company branding?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Our invoice template editor allows you to customize every aspect of your invoices including adding your company logo, selecting brand colors, adjusting layout, and including custom fields. You can create multiple templates for different customer segments or service types, ensuring professional and consistent branding across all your billing communications."
    },
    {
      question: "How does recurring billing work?",
      answer: "Our recurring billing system allows you to automate invoices for service agreements, maintenance contracts, or subscriptions. You can set flexible billing cycles (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually), define pricing tiers, and automatically prorate for mid-cycle changes. The system handles invoice generation, payment processing, and notifications without manual intervention."
    },
    {
      question: "What about multi-currency support for international customers?",
      answer: "Fielduo provides robust multi-currency support with automatic conversion based on current exchange rates. You can invoice customers in their preferred currency while managing your books in your base currency. The system handles exchange rate fluctuations, provides clear currency conversion details on invoices, and supports multi-currency reporting for comprehensive financial management."
    },
    {
      question: "How are taxes calculated and managed?",
      answer: "Our tax management system automatically calculates and applies taxes based on geographic location, product/service type, and customer tax status. We maintain up-to-date tax rates for multiple jurisdictions and can handle complex scenarios including compound taxes, exemptions, and special tax rules. All tax calculations are clearly displayed on invoices and detailed in financial reports."
    },
    {
      question: "Can customers pay immediately after service completion?",
      answer: "Yes, our mobile payment feature allows technicians to process payments immediately upon job completion using their mobile devices. This improves cash flow by eliminating the delay between service delivery and payment receipt. Customers receive instant receipts via email or SMS, and payments are automatically reconciled with the corresponding invoices."
    },
    {
      question: "How do payment reminders work?",
      answer: "Our automated reminder system sends customizable email or SMS notifications for upcoming due dates, past-due invoices, and payment confirmations. You can set up multiple reminder sequences, personalize messaging, and track delivery and response rates. The system automatically escalates reminders for overdue accounts and can pause communications once payment is received."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the typical timeline for receiving payments?",
      answer: "With Fielduo, businesses typically see a 20% reduction in days-sales-outstanding. Electronic payments are usually processed within 1-3 business days, while traditional methods like checks may take 5-7 business days. Our automated reminders and multiple payment options help accelerate the payment process, improving overall cash flow."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the payment processing secure?",
      answer: "Security is our top priority. We use bank-level encryption, PCI DSS compliance, and tokenization to protect sensitive payment information. All transactions are processed through secure gateways with advanced fraud detection. We also provide detailed audit trails, user access controls, and regular security assessments to ensure the highest level of protection for your financial data."
